    "- they reach sexual maturity in four to five years\n",
    "- when males are about 7 - 9 feet\n",
    "- when females are at least 9 feet\n",
    "- females lay about every 10 months\n",
    "- ~3 months after mating they are ready to lay eggs\n",
    "- they can lay up to 100 eggs at a time, but the average is about 78 in the Florida Everglades\n",
    "- after about 6 - 8 weeks the eggs will hatch\n",
    "- expected mortality of eggs is about 10%\n",
    "- hatchling eat very little during the first about 2 weeks of life as they rely on internal yolk stores\n",
    "- pythons grow to about 3 feet in the first 9 months, and about 6 feet in the first 12 months\n",
    "- the snakes live up to between 15 - 25 years of age\n",
